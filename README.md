# ISSUES: had issues with the swap. My swapNum function worked but it didn't appear that it did swap because I was swapping layer one for layer one. Once I changed the swap the layer two then it layer changed. Also had issues with figuring our how to stop the swapping and have the fortune show. I requested help from Blakeley and she helped me work through it

# RESOURCES: I only used the videos provided in the class modules
